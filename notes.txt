To perform a likelihood ratio multinomial test on two vectors of different sums,
we need to specify the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. Let's assume we have two vectors,
 vector A and vector B, and we want to test if they have the same underlying distribution.

Null hypothesis (H0): Vector A and Vector B have the same underlying distribution.
Alternative hypothesis (H1): Vector A and Vector B do not have the same underlying distribution.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to perform a likelihood ratio multinomial test:

Step 1: Calculate the observed frequencies:
   - For vector A, calculate the observed frequency of each category.
   - For vector B, calculate the observed frequency of each category.

Step 2: Calculate the expected frequencies:
   - Combine the two vectors to obtain the total number of observations in each category.
   - Calculate the expected frequency of each category assuming that both vectors have the same underlying distribution.
   - This can be done by summing the observed frequencies for each category and then dividing by the total number
        of observations.

Step 3: Calculate the likelihood ratio statistic:
   - Calculate the likelihood ratio statistic (G) using the formula: G = 2 * ∑(O * ln(O/E)),
    where O represents the observed frequency and E represents the expected frequency for each category.

Step 4: Determine the degrees of freedom:
   - Degrees of freedom (df) is equal to the number of categories minus 1. In this case,
    it would be the number of categories in the vectors minus 1.

Step 5: Calculate the p-value:
   - Calculate the p-value associated with the likelihood ratio statistic using the chi-square
    distribution with the degrees of freedom obtained in Step 4.

Step 6: Compare the p-value with the significance level (α):
   - If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (α), typically 0.05,
   reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the vectors have different underlying distributions.
   - If the p-value is greater than or equal to the significance level, fail to reject the null hypothesis
    and conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest that the vectors have different underlying distributions.
